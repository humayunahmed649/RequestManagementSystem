        <h4>Scope of the System</h4>
        <p>

    The project aims at providing an efficient interface to the BCC for managing their vehicle requisition based on current manual process in automate. The basic idea involved here is that vehicle and employee, driver are stored in a database. When system get a requisition request, the system analyzes the schedule, vehicle, availability of driver in database and send it to the vehicle manager (admin) for approval.

    We also propose to include a feature “Feedback”. This feature keeps track of any objection from vehicle user or any inquiry to the vehicle manager and also from vehicle manager to the vehicle user about any instruction.
